## Web project.

The main premise of this application is to run a small blog with chat option

## What does this project have?

1. It has two main sides:
   - Microblog
   - Chat
2. In the central part, we can add entries that are approved by pressing a button
3. Posts are displayed from newest to oldest, dated and timed
4. The post title is a post but trimmed to 30 characters
5. The footer is not fully ready yet, it is provisional and the links in it do not work yet
6. The chat section is based on Microblog with small type differences:
   - it is designed for chatting with friends
   - with a specific background
   - only with time in subtitle

## What else is in it?

- On smaller screens the site will adapt
- Main part is glued to the central part of the page
- Is set to have a maximum of seven entries displayed
